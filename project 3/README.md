## 📸 About

This is my personal portfolio site as a **2nd-year B.Sc Computer Science student** from **Haldia Institute of Management** (4th Semester).

The site highlights:
- Two hands-on AI/ML projects completed during a workshop
- My skills in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn
- My learning journey in AI, Automation, and LLMs
- Contact info and links to GitHub & LinkedIn

Mentored by **SK Sahil** (AI Developer & Tutor) via **Code_ScholarEU**.

```js
const LINKS = {
  githubProfile:   "https://github.com/your-username",
  linkedin:        "https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile",
  project1Repo:    "https://github.com/your-username/project-1",
  project2Repo:    "https://github.com/your-username/project-2",
  project1Notebook: "https://colab.research.google.com/...",
  project2Notebook: "https://colab.research.google.com/...",
  email:           "your@email.com"
};
```

Also replace `Student Name` in the `<h1>` with your actual name.
